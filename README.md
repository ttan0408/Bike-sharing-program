# Bike-sharing-program

We are working with Kate to open a "Bike Sharing" bissiness similiar to NYC in Des Moines. Before we are talking to investor, we need to do some analysis using Citi Bike program in New York City. In this study, first we need to clean the data .csv file by converting tripduration to datatime format. Using Python and Pandas funtion we were able to convert tripduration to datetime format. The .ipynb file is shown below :

After exporting new .csv file we create Tableau project in order to create visualiztion and anylyze the data. We divide the analysis into 5 categories :

   The purpose of this visualiztion is to understand what is the aveage checkout time for users in NYC so we can estimate the base revenue for our new bussiness.

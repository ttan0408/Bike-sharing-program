# Bike-sharing-program

We are working with Kate to open a "Bike Sharing" bissiness similiar to NYC in Des Moines. Before we are talking to investor, we need to do some analysis using Citi Bike program in New York City. In this study, first we need to clean the data .csv file by converting tripduration to datatime format. Using Python and Pandas funtion we were able to convert tripduration to datetime format. The .ipynb file is shown below :

After exporting new .csv file we create Tableau project in order to create visualiztion and anylyze the data. We divide the analysis into 5 categories : 

## Checkout Time for Users
   The purpose of this visualiztion is to understand what is the aveage checkout time for users in NYC so we can estimate the base revenue for our new bussiness. It is i          interesting to see that the average checkout time is about 4-6 hours, and this can be use to calculate the minimum revenue for our bussiness.
   
   The checkout Time for Users is shown below :

## Checkout Time by Gender
   So we know that users are biking from 4-6 hours, but we need to understand more to see which gender is prefer biking so we can create some more advertising depend on each      gender. In this analysis we see that male tend to prefer biking than female and the plot/chart is shown below :
   
   Male prefer biking than female :

## Trips by Weekday per Hour
  Monday -Friday 7AM-8AM has  consistent busy checkout time while Monday, Tuesday, Thrsday between 5PM-6PM has high checkout time. With this we can set up the time for bike     maintenance without interfer the business income.
